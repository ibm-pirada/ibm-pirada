### Hi there 👋

Nice to meet you :) My name is Pirada but please just call me 'Earn'!

## About Me 😄

💻 Full Stack Developer & Application Consultant at IBM Consulting 💼
Bringing cloud transformation projects to life one code line at a time 🌩️
Always up for a challenge and a good cup of coffee ☕️

🌃 Night Owl Alert 🌃
I'm a fan of coding under the moonlight 🌕 just a little too much 🙈. So excuse me if I'm a bit drowsy during the day 💤

## 💬 Let's chat!

Feel free to reach out to me on slack, MSTeam, or LinkedIn. I'd love to chat about anything from software development to cute cats. 🐈 

## ⚡ Fun fact

- Instead of just singing in the shower, I now have a full concert audience of my pets while I belt out my favorite tunes during WFH karaoke sessions. 🎤🎶
